💻 I’m Nawaf, passionate about engineering and building solutions.
I enjoy exploring how things work, experimenting with new tech, and not sharing my projects with the community.

🚀 What I’m Working On
🔧 Exploring mechanical engineering concepts and sustainable technologies

🤖 Building projects in Python, robotics, and AI-powered tools

🌱 Continuously learning, from small automation scripts to larger open‑source contributions

💡 Interests
✨ Physics and problem‑solving
🎨 Creative design and prototyping
🛠️ Open‑source collaboration(downloading open source mods for minecraft) and learning from others

💬 Always open to collaborating on innovative projects or exchanging ideas.
🌟 Let’s build something awesome together!

If you’d like, I can also help you add badges (like languages, tools, or stats) or a dynamic section (like GitHub stats/cards). Let me know!
